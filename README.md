### Continued development

Study promises! 
### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/introduction-to-fetch/) Post about form fetch function.
- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - To consult about doubts that appeared.
- [mdn_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner. I also like that it's available in many languages (very important!).
